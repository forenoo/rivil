# UI Design Guidelines

## Core Design Principles
- Employ minimalist design with clean lines and generous whitespace
- Create modern interfaces with subtle shadows and depth
- Follow Apple-inspired design language (rounded corners, typography)
- Use the appTheme and appColor variables for consistent branding

## Color Usage
- Primary actions should use colorScheme.primary
- Secondary elements should use muted versions of the primary color
- Backgrounds should use neutral colors (white, light grays)
- Use colorScheme properties for semantic meaning (error, success, etc.)
- Implement proper color contrast for accessibility

## Typography
- Use a clear type hierarchy with consistent font weights
- Limit to 3 font sizes per screen (heading, body, caption)
- Use proper letter spacing for readability (-0.5 for headings)
- Text should have appropriate contrast against backgrounds

## Component Design
- Buttons should have rounded corners (12px radius)
- Text fields should use subtle backgrounds (Colors.grey.shade100)
- Cards should have minimal borders and soft shadows
- Icons should be simple and follow a consistent style

## Layout
- Use responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes
- Employ proper padding (16-24px) around content sections
- Align elements to a consistent grid
- Maintain proper spacing between interface elements
- Ensure touch targets are at least 44x44px

## Animations
- Use subtle animations for state changes
- Transitions should be smooth and purposeful
- Follow the "gentle" animation curve for natural movement
- Keep animation durations between 200-300ms

## Images and Media
- Use high-quality imagery with consistent styling
- Apply subtle rounding to image corners
- Implement proper image loading states
- Maintain aspect ratios for media content
